# Sound Files for Workout Timer

This directory should contain the following sound files:

- `rest-complete.mp3` - Played when rest period completes
- `exercise-transition.mp3` - Played when transitioning to next exercise
- `workout-complete.mp3` - Played when workout is finished
- `tick.mp3` - Played during countdown for last 10 seconds

## Note

These files are placeholders. In a production environment, you would:

1. Add actual audio files (MP3, WAV, or OGG format)
2. Ensure files are optimized for web (small file sizes)
3. Consider providing multiple format options for browser compatibility
4. Test audio playback across different devices and browsers

For development/testing purposes, the timer will still function without these files - audio playback will simply fail silently.
